Welcome to BoussinesqCode's documentation!
==========================================

## Overview

This is a Fourier-based spectral Fortran code to solve the Boussinesq equations.
The numerical code has been originally developed by Peter Bartello and Michael Waite and subsequently modified by Hossein Kafiabad.
The numerical scheme is described in detail in the papers: Bartello (1995) and Waite (2017).
